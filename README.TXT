Based on the work of Estwald, Marioga and other scene members and bookstores like PSL1GHT, 
Tiny3D and PS3 Soundlib, PSDK3 aims to be a stable environment of programming homebrew on PS3 under Windows,
without external influences that threaten the integrity of the libraries, and applications that are built with them,
when someone decides to change it all, breaking compatibility with applications built with those libraries and 
causing light damage. Here the motto is 'if something works, don't touch it' and it can add things, 
but not subtract, nor fiddling with code.
